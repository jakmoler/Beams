Dear Wenjamin Rosenfeld
Hi!
I would need for my research study a laser beam profiler, unfortunately these devices are very expensive and I just don't have the budget for one.
I think I could use the CCD or CMOS chip of a digital SLR camera for this purpose, but I don't have any data about the software for this webcam.
are you can send  for me a open source software that used as a beamrofiler please?
